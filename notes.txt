I want to develop n-dimensional games for anyone who wants that mental trip. In 2003 I built a 3-dimensional tic-tac-toe, and wanted to make 4-d, but did't have the tools or time. This is my back-burner

Notes
-----
Matplotlib and pyplot
- I can plot out by hand any point in 4D space, where it would fall on a 2D representation.
  But the trick is using a tool with sufficient computer graphics capabilities to take the 2D
  representation of the 4D game space, and rotate and pivot it around so that the observer is
  able to picture what's happening. It's just one step beyond 3D graphics.
